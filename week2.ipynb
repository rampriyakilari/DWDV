      "\n",
      "Text mining is a ﬁeld related to data analytic consisting in the analysis of textual data. A textual data point can be a\n",
      "character, a word, a sentence, paragraph or a full document. As text data is unstructured (opposed to tabular data), it\n",

      "Most of the time, text is analysed by a human who can read the text and transform it into structured information. It can\n",
      "take a lot of time when it comes to analyzing thousands of sentences. Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to\n",
      "the capacity of copying the human reading process. Both terms \"Text mining\" or \"Natural Language Processing\" are\n",
      "used in the industry to refer to text manipulation with algorithms (despite some differences between both concepts).\n",
      "More than just mining text, NLP also tries to capture the complexity of the language and translates it into summarized\n",
      "information that a computer could use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowadays, text is everywhere. It is the main information we all use. Text is present in every website, report, or any other\n",
      "digital mean of communication. Thus, Natural Language Processing paves the way towards numerous opportunities\n",

      "2 Opportunities for the insurance industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "In insurance, NLP can be leveraged at many steps of a policy life cycle. We present below some examples. Details on\n",
      "some use cases are also presented later in this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Marketing: NLP has been used to enhance marketing actions for a couple of years by different insurance\n",
      "companies. At SCOR, we used it to monitor the sentiment analysis of comments to better consider insured\n",
      "needs or monitor the perception on a speciﬁc risk (e.g. what people are thinking about a particular product). It\n",
      "is common also to process feedback that people publish on different social networks such as Twitter, Reddit\n",
      "or press articles to extract some trends in expectations and then better pilot the strategy of the company.\n",
      "Automating comments analysis enable a live monitoring of what is published on the internet. NLP model can\n",
      "indeed convert text into a general sentiment score or extract the topic they are referring to. If the underlying\n",
      "NLP technique can be sophisticated and have been evolving, it performs pretty well and the challenge is more\n",
      "about integrating such models into operational daily business. We illustrate this challenge and some solutions\n",
      "in paragraphs below.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Underwriting: At the re-insurance level, underwriters need to analyse a large number of policies at each\n",
      "renewal period. After digitalization of the contract, many text mining applications are possible on the wordings\n",
      "in order to track changes and check compliance. It makes the underwriting process friction-less and enable a\n",
      "better monitoring and change tracking in clauses. Those automatic checks might also be useful for the insured\n",
      "to provide more transparency on the coverage of the policies from one period to another. In life insurance,\n",
      "many opportunities are also opened such as enhancing medical report analysis. By coupling Optical Character\n",
      "Recognition (OCR)2 and NLP we can indeed extract information from Medical reports and help underwriters\n",
      "to focus on most difﬁcult cases while others can take less time to process. In another coming paper, we will\n",
      "detail how for instance NLP can be used to automatically anonymize documents with Personal Information\n",
      "\n",
      "2A paper focusing of this topic will be released soon\n",

      "A PREPRINT - OCTOBER 2, 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "and then process data compliant with GDPR. We explain in this article one of the key NLP method that can be\n",
      "used for anonymization which is called Name Entity Recognition (NER).\n",
      "\n",
      "• Claims: Textual analysis of claims and classiﬁcation are two topics where SCOR has been using NLP. It can\n",
      "simplify acceptance of claims in the process to reduce time treatment, operational errors or even help in fraud\n",
      "detection. We detail below how text mining can be used for claims adjudication or to optimize human reading\n",
      "to classify claims and route them to the appropriate department.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Reserving: Analyzing comments of claim reports during the First Notiﬁcation of Loss or expert claims\n",
      "assessment is more and more developed in insurance company to improve reserving for severe claims.\n",
      "Descriptions can provide valuable information to anticipate the development of claim and better estimate the\n",
      "expected cost. In life insurance, the assessment of expert reports could help in reserve projection. It could for\n",
      "instance help in Long Term Care or speciﬁc Critical Illness products where risk factors can be cross correlated\n",
      "to different dependent diseases. Despite the low annual frequency of such reports, the amount of document\n",
      "can become signiﬁcant on a long time study period for which a systematic approach is useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Prevention: Enhancing Medical Diagnostic is another opportunity for NLP. It could help doctors to ensure\n",
      "they cover all possible diseases matching with symptoms. In this particular ﬁeld, the challenge is to train\n",
      "NLP models on medical data that have a speciﬁc vocabulary. Early diagnostic is really key to ensure good\n",
      "health of people and avoid complications. Some systems already exists to capture different ﬁelds but they are\n",
      "quite time consuming. Doctors have to ﬁll many ﬁelds that are structured in templates and most of the time\n",
      "free comments are not allowed (while they are the most easy to use). In such application, NLP models must\n",
      "be applied in compliance with highly secured systems (anonymization of data, local computation, etc.). We\n",
      "detail further in this article some technologies that can be used to embed NLP model into solutions and help in\n",
      "respecting such constraints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manipulating text, provides many new opportunities in the insurance industry. We explain further in this paper how\n",
      "to apply the different techniques of Natural Language Processing in order to deliver business use cases. The article\n",
      "gradually explains the different steps that are commonly used in text manipulation and illustrates how new state-of-the\n",
      "art NLP models can help insurance industry to process for instance claims description, or to adjudicate claims based on\n",
      "report and then optimize payment process (by focusing investigation on most relevant cases). However, if research has\n",
      "been doing tremendous progress in text manipulation, it is not without challenges to apply the different techniques to\n",
      "the industry and provide NLP based product.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 Main challenges to embed NLP models into solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1 How to access or collect useful text data?\n",
      "\n",
      "Text data are almost everywhere. We use them to communicate and send information that are stored into different layers:\n",
      "emails, reports, websites, information systems, logs, etc. However, they are also one the less exploited information\n",
      "by industries. If data are stored everywhere, gathering them (i.e. relevant text information) can be a real challenge.\n",
      "In legacy industries like insurance, text data are stored within paper documents that most of the time are scanned.\n",
      "Capturing and extracting those information is the ﬁrst challenge to be able then to use text into NLP models. Some\n",
      "methods based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that SCOR implemented to overcome that ﬁrst extraction step\n",
      "will be detailed in another paper coming in Q4 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "For most recent digital systems, text is easier to access and can be either collected directly from databases lying\n",
      "behind applications, websites, social media or by simply converting documents (like pdf generated by an information\n",
      "system). When it comes to collecting data from social media, like Twitter, Reddit, etc. those are usually providing some\n",
      "connectors (APIs) that allow to collect information in a more structured format. In any cases, as for regular tabular data,\n",
      "the collect of text must be driven by an initial business issue. Collecting text information without restriction can indeed\n",
      "lead to bias and noise that algorithms might struggle to deal with since relations between text and business issue will be\n",
      "harder to detect.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2 Enrich traditional information to enhance services.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, text data are mainly used in addition to more traditional tabular data. For example, to speed up payment\n",
      "process, free text that describes the claim can be added to tabular data that contain more traditional information (policy,\n",
      "claim date, type, etc.). Text is usually really rich information that humans process to take decision or to explain context.\n",
      "This speciﬁc context is most of the time a piece of information that is difﬁcult to capture within structured data.\n",

      "postal code in an address, an entity name or even a relationship). This approach is thus very limited in many situations.\n",
      "Less restrictive alternatives have appeared in order to be able to extract information from free text. Particularly favored\n",
      "by the development of the internet and the growth in the number of websites full of textual information [Aggarwal and\n",
      "Zhai 2012b], the researchers are initially interested in using semi-structured text in HTML format [Banko et al. 2007].\n",
      "We therefore distinguish two major tasks which form the basis of the NLP [Jiang 2012]:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Recognition of the name of an entity designated most of the time by the acronym NER (Name Entity\n",
      "Recognition): these techniques are concerned with extracting, from a text, the value of a common or proper\n",
      "name but also extends to the recognition of metric values (date, price, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "• The extraction of relations, referring to techniques trying to determine the logical links between the different\n",
      "words of a text. From a raw or semi-structured text, the challenge is to ﬁnd the grammatical relationships\n",

      "The easiest way to implement name entity recognition is to use rules. When a pattern is detected, a rule is applied. The\n",
      "use of regular expressions [Califf and Mooney 1999] makes it possible to extract textual information which follows a\n",

      "The goal of the preprocessing is to prepare text representation so it can feed a parametric models (e.g. linear regression)\n",
      "by cleaning the data. Indeed, all strings must have a similar form and unnecessary elements must be removed from our\n",
      "inputs since they can introduce noise. The most essential preprocessing steps are:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Loading the text: It is common, when dealing with speciﬁc characters like accents to face encoding issues.\n",
      "This part aims to solve text representation and encoding problems using the \"unicodedata\" library. Encoding\n",
      "conversion from Latin1 to UTF8 (e.g. when dealing with mix of French and English words) can be applied\n",
      "before processing the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Lowercasing: It is the operation of converting all letters to lowercase. This will get rid of any ambiguity\n",

      "string objects (\".lower()\" for instance in Python).\n",
      "\n",
      "• Stopwords removal: When communicating, humans must use words such as “the”, “and” or “a” for sentences\n",
      "to make sense, however these words do not carry any meaning and are not useful for data analysis. Getting\n",
      "rid of these words called stopwords is a preprocessing step that allows focusing on words that matter. Each\n",
      "language possesses its own list of stopwords that can be adjusted according to the problem. The ﬁrst idea\n",
      "of stopwords appeared in an article by Luhn (1960). Lists of predeﬁned stopwords for many languages are\n",
      "available in NLTK10.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Special characters processing: an attention is brought to special characters. Indeed, while some of them are not\n",
      "necessary, others are needed for sentiment analysis. For instance, an exclamation point in a tweet can express\n",
      "an emphasis on its sentiment. People tend to increase the number of exclamation points when dealing with\n",
      "strong sentiments. Therefore, punctuation characters can be kept or treated as stopwords. The \"re\" library is\n",
      "used to remove duplicated punctuation symbols as well as other superﬁcial pieces of text like URLs or Twitter\n",
